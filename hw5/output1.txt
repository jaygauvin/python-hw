Students Alumni Employers Username: Password: First time logging in? Forgot your password? New Alumni Users: Please click here to create an account . Username: Password: Forgot your password? New Employer Users: Please click here to create an account . Self Assessment The first step in the career development process is self-assessment . In order to determine what major and career is right for you, a firm understanding of your skills, traits, values, and interests is required. The FOCUS Career Assessment system can help! FOCUS is based on Holland Occupational Theory, which states that since jobs have skills and traits that define them, people with matching skills and traits will likely enjoy and thrive in that career. You will be asked questions related to your skills (things you do well), your work and leisure interests (things you like to do), your personality type, and your work values (things you want from your career) and then FOCUS provides you majors and occupations that match your input. What Can I Do? What can you do with your major? This question poses a challenge to many college students. With careful planning and preparation, your experiences and career-related skills can prepare you to optimize your degree options in ways you may have never considered. Based on our degree programs, the Career Development Center has profiled majors from the five colleges and has provided career options correlating to the majors. This information provides an expansive view of potential opportunities available to you. Find out what you can do here! Resumes|Cover Letters The goal of a resume is to get the interview. A resume does not get you the job! The resume is your first impression to a prospective employer, and therefore it needs to be well-written, factual, and relevant to the job in which you are applying. A resume is a marketing tool , designed to sell you to a prospective employer. A resume is not for your past; it is to market yourself for the next job! Click here for more information on writing a great resume! A cover letter is the companion document to the resume; it is an introductory letter that guides an employer through your resume. A well-written, well-set up cover letter will encourage an employer to read your resume the way you want it read. The letter will highlight your specific skills and traits for the job, point out your related experiences, and explain how you will perform on the job. Cover letters absolutely are necessary. You should begin to think of Resume and Cover Letter as one word: Resumecoverletter. When someone asks for your resume, you also provide the cover letter. Click here for more information on writing the perfect cover letter!

The IDEA Council is committed to bringing together students, faculty, staff, administrators and alumni of all identities. These identities including, among others, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, religion, varying physical ability and mental abilities, marital status, national origin, socioeconomic status, creed, class, age, profession, veteran status and regional identity carry socially constructed meaning and value. As members of the Council, our commitment is to the cultural competency, intercultural and personal development that is best supported in a climate that respects differences and provides a sense of belonging and inclusion. At the University of New Haven, diversity means embracing and celebrating the many differences that exist among the members of a dynamic, intellectual and inclusive community and welcoming the full spectrum of human characteristics, ideas and world views. As such, the IDEA Council strongly values the broad range of perspectives arising from our diverse society and the campus community. Diversity stimulates learning, encourages imagination and benefits all students, employees and the greater community. It creates an environment that fosters appreciation of the values, skills and abilities of everyone.

Any student whose cumulative QPR is below 3.0 will be placed on academic probation and will be required to obtain written permission from the program coordinator prior to registering for additional coursework. The program coordinator or designee may provide written conditions, beyond specifying the current term course registration, which would be included in the student's academic record. Academic Dismissal A student whose cumulative QPR is below 2.7 after completion of 15 credit hours will be dismissed from the Graduate School. Any student who has been dismissed may submit an appeal to the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies. If the appeal is granted, written conditions for the student must accompany the permission to continue in the Graduate School. These would be included in the student's academic record. Undergraduate Probation and Dismissal Academic Probation Students are placed on academic probation when they fail to maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average in accordance with the following satisfactory progress scale: Cumulative grade point average of 1.75 for 3 to 27 credits attempted; Cumulative grade point average of 1.85 for 28 to 57 credits attempted; Cumulative grade point average of 2.0 for 58 or more credits attempted. Academic probation of transfer students is determined in accordance with the same graduated, minimum cumulative grade point average scale as for non-transfer students, as detailed above. In determining a transfer student's academic standing, the student's total semester hours completed - those transferred from other institutions plus those attempted at the University of New Haven - are applied to the minimum cumulative grade point average scale. Students who are on academic probation are limited to a course load not to exceed four courses (13 credits). Any course above the four-course limit taken by a student at another institution during a period of academic probation will not be accepted for credit by the university. The counting of the number of academic probations for any student shall not change as the result of an academic dismissal. A student shall be dismissed automatically as a result of the third or, if readmitted, any subsequent probation. Academic Dismissal Students are dismissed from the university (1) upon qualification for a third probation, (2) upon qualification for any subsequent probation after readmission from an academic dismissal, or (3) when the student's grade point average for any individual semester is less than 1.0 and the student's cumulative grade point average does not indicate satisfactory progress as described in the scale above. If the cumulative grade point average indicates satisfactory progress as described in the scale above, an academic warning will be issued instead of an academic dismissal.

Students should submit to the registrar, dean, head of academic department or other appropriate official written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The university official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the university official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. ( 2) The right to request the amendment of the student s education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the university to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the university official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the university decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the university will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. (3) The right to consent to disclosures of personally iden-tifiable information contained in the student s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception which permits disclosure without consent is a disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the university has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Governors; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. (4) The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University New Haven to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA are: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20202-4605.
