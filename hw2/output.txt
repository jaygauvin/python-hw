Found at 31: For millions of years flowers have been producing thorns. For milli
ons of years sheep have been eating them all the same. And it's not serious, try
ing to understand why flowers go to such trouble to produce thorns that are good
 for nothing? It's not important, the war between the sheep and the flowers? It'
s no more serious and more important than the numbers that fat red gentleman is
adding up? Suppose I happen to know a unique flower, one that exists nowhere in
the world except on my planet, one that a little sheep can wipe out in a single
bite one morning, just like that, without even realizing what he'd doing - that
isn't important? If someone loves a flower of which just one example exists amon
g all the millions and millions of stars, that's enough to make him happy when h
e looks at the stars. He tells himself 'My flower's up there somewhere...' But i
f the sheep eats the flower, then for him it's as if, suddenly, all the stars we
nt out. And that isn't important?

Found at 10: If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at t
he sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers...

Found at 25: The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, t
hat he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, t
hat is a proof that he exists.

Found at 38: I ought not to have listened to her,' he confided to me one day. 'O
ne never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and brea
the their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take
 pleasure in all her grace.

Found at 44: Of course, I love you,' the flower said to him. 'If you were not aw
are of it, it was my fault.

Found at 47: You know...my flower...I'm responsible for her. And she's so weak!
And so naive. She has four ridiculous thorns to defend her against the world...

Found at 58: "What a queer planet!" he thought. "It is altogether dry, and altog
ether pointed, and altogether harsh and forbidding. And the people have no imagi
nation. They repeat whatever one says to them . . . On my planet I had a flower;
 she always was the first to speak . . .

Found at 59: I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He ha
s never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any
one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he s
ays over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence!' And t
hat makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man - he is a mushroom!

Found at 71: But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxe
s. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.

Found at 77: If someone loves a flower of which just one exists among all the mi
llions and millions of stars, that's enough to make him happy when he looks at t
he stars.

Found at 79: Will you draw me a sheep?

Found at 81: If you love a flower that lives on a star, then it's good at night,
 to look up at the sky. All the stars are blossoming.
